Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means. You’ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 3. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses.

        "description": "Learn about one of the most powerful Deep Learning architectures yet! The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and generating photo-realistic images of people and things that don't exist in the real world! This course will teach you the fundamentals of convolution and why it's useful for deep learning and even NLP (natural language processing). You will learn about modern techniques such as data augmentation and batch normalization, and build modern architectures such as VGG yourself."
